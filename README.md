# LSTM_GDP-M2_Prediction

Use the LSTM deep learning to predict GDP and Money Supply growth in percentage changes.

The project needs some adjustements on the parameters but it is almost done. 

Despite all adjustments the model suffers from the black swan effect, in other words, the model is not capables of capturing the drastic changes on the GDP 
due to the abrupt drop caused by the covid-19 crisis and the sharp rise that happened after the lockdown.
